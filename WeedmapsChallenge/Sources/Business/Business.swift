//    What image resolution options do you offer for business photos and user profile photos?
//    By default, we return the original full-sized resolution; we use 'o' for business photos from the Business Details endpoint and 'o' for user profile photos (image_url) in the Reviews endpoint. Here are the different resolutions we currently provide:
//    
//    'o' (original): Up to 1,000x1,000
//    'l' (large): Up to 600x400
//    'm' (medium): Up to 100x100
//    'ms' (medium square): 100x100
//    's' (small): Up to 40x40
//    'ss' (small square): 40x40
//

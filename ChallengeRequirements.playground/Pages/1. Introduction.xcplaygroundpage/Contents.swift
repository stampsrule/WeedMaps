 2)
 ## Tests
 
 - Add unit tests for any network interfaces created. These unit tests should make use of test data.
 - Add a minimum of 1 XCUI test testing part of your interface. There is an example test provided for you in the project template.
 ================================================================================================
 3)
 - We expect you to build your networking layer with scalability in mind. Try to avoid hard coded URLs when available and operate under the assumption that you could port this to a production ready application.
 ================================================================================================
 4)
 
 ## Packaging
 
 - Package your source code and host in a publicly accessible git repository.
 [Github](https://www.Github.com)
 [Bitbucket](https://www.Bitbucket.com)
 [Gitlab](https://www.Gitlab.com)

 - Support various width devices (should an iPad and iPhone SE share the same size traits?)

 ================================================================================================
 
 We would like to see solutions making use of functional programming, types, protocols, and generics, etc.

 ================================================================================================
 
 
 - There is an additional FavoritesViewController.swift class that you may implement if you have additional time and want to show off more of your skills. This can simply display a UITableView or UICollectionView
 that lists the items that a user has tapped on, ranked by how often a user has viewed the details for a specific business. For example, if Joe's Pizza business detail view (either in Safari or from the WKWebView) was viewed twice via the details from the HomeViewController, and World's Best Burgers was viewed 4 times,
 the data would be displayed as World's Best Burgers in row 0 and Joe's Pizza in row 1.
